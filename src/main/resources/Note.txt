In somecases, the resource server ppl use from Google, GitHub or any such 3rd party provider.


1. To Access UserAPI the user needs to obtain a token by calling /oauth/token url  (which is a standard way)
2. Which user can access API ? the users who have their client_id and client_secret.
   Which is hardcoded in AuthServerConfig.java (this can be externalized or use a DB)
