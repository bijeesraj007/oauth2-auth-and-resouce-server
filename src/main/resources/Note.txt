In this project the Authorization Server & Resource Server (API) both are in the same project.
In some cases, the resource server (Api Server like PRODUCT-API) would be in a different server. In that case the way to authenticate token might invoke additional work. (there are few methods)


1. To Access UserAPI the user needs to obtain a token by calling /oauth/token url  (which is a standard way)
2. Which user can access API ? the users who have their client_id and client_secret.
   Which is hardcoded in AuthServerConfig.java (this can be externalized or use a DB)
